            <h3>About where its from:</h3>
            <p>Fushimi Inari Shrine, located in Kyoto, is the most prominent and significant shrine dedicated to Inari, the Shinto fox god of rice and prosperity. The legend goes, a rice cake was shot into the air, which turned into a swan and flew away, eventually landing on a peak of a mountain, where rice grew (an auspicious omen in Japan). This led to the deity Inari Okami (the god of rice) being enshrined on the plateau and the start of Fushimi Inari Taisha. Founded in 711 CE by the Hata clan, the shrine was originally situated on Mt. Inari and later moved to its current location near Kyoto in the 9th century. </p>
            <p>Fushimi Inari Taisha is known for its thousands of vermilion torii gates that span the trails up Mount Inari. The shrine has long been a patron of business, merchants, and manufacturers, and is one of Kyoto’s oldest and most historic landmarks. This shrine is one of the best instagrammable spots to go if you visit Kyoto, but I recommend coming early in the morning to avoid other people in your photos!</p>
