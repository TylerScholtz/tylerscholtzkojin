            <h3>About where its from:</h3>
            <p>Kiyomizu-dera is a significant Buddhist temple located on Mount Otowa, on the eastern outskirts of Kyoto. The temple was founded in 780 AD during the Heian period by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro. Its location was initially established in 778 CE by the Buddhist monk Enchin, who was inspired by a vision to find a spring of pure water.</p>
            <p>At the base of Kiyomizu-dera's main hall, there's the Otowa Waterfall, which divides into three streams. Visitors to the temple often drink from these streams, believing that each stream has a specific benefit: longevity, success at school, and a fortunate love life. However, it's considered greedy to drink from all three.</p>
            <p>There's a saying in Japanese, "to jump off the stage at Kiyomizu," which is similar to the English phrase "to take the plunge." This phrase originates from an Edo-period tradition where it was believed that if one survived a 13-meter jump from the temple's stage, their wish would be granted. Over 200 jumps were recorded in the Edo period, and surprisingly, the survival rate was over 80%. However, this practice is now prohibited due to its obvious danger.</p>
