            <h3>About where its from:</h3>
            <p>Kinkaku-ji Temple, also known as the Golden Pavilion, is a renowned Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan. It was initially built in 1397 as a retirement villa for Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. The site was formerly the location of a villa owned by statesman Saionji Kintsune. After Yoshimitsu's death in 1408, his son transformed the villa into a temple, as per his father's wishes. The temple is notable for its top two floors, which are completely covered in gold leaf, and it is officially named Rokuon-ji (Deer Garden Temple). Kinkaku-ji is celebrated for its tranquil and beautiful setting, contributing to its status as one of Kyoto's most popular and visually striking landmarks. It‚Äôs also my favourite temple in all of Japan. </p>

        <h3>About the meaning of your specific talisman:</h3>
        <p>   The front side of the talisman reads "Kinkaku-ji Feng Shui Talisman", "Direction Avoidance", and "Misfortune Avoidance" in Japanese. The talisman is embroidered with the "Four Gods (Shijin)" of China: Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and Azure Dragon. This concept of the Four Gods was introduced to Japan from China, where it was believed that all things, living and non-living, are composed of 'Qi'. </p>
        <p> Kinkaku-ji's "Feng Shui Talisman" is an octagonal talisman. In Feng Shui, the octagonal shape is considered the best, believed to enhance various effects. The eight directions - North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest - each have their own fortunes (like love, money, health, honor, etc.). Thus, the octagonal shape is thought to represent all meanings and is meant to attract the energy of all eight directions.</p>
        <p> From a Feng Shui perspective, the entire city of Kyoto has been constructed with Feng Shui principles in mind, and among them, the area around Kinkaku-ji, located on the Kitayama Mountain, is considered one of the highest power spots in Japan. Shwimmy, as I find you are already a well-balanced person, I hope this talisman can bring you more calamity to your life.</p>
