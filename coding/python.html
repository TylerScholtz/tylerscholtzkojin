  <h2>My Coding Journey: 100 Days of Code</a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio! As a passionate learner and aspiring developer, I am currently undertaking the '<a href="https://bit.ly/44Qn4pA" target="_blank">100 Days of Code</a>' course on Udemy. This section of my portfolio is dedicated to showcasing my progress and the skills I am acquiring throughout this intensive course.</p>
  <p>Embedded below is a live Replit workspace where I regularly update my code as I progress through the course. Feel free to explore, run the code, and witness my coding journey in real-time. I hope my progress inspires you as much as this journey inspires me.</p>
